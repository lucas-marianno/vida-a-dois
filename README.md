# VidaADois

VidaADois is a mobile app tailored to improve life as a couple. It helps couples manage their lives together more efficiently.

## Features

### Task Manager

Manage tasks efficiently with the Kanban task manager. Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks, assign them to one another, set deadlines, and create checklists. It's inspired by Jira's Kanban but focused on two people.

## Upcoming Features

### Financial Manager

Track every single expense with the financial manager. Easily log and categorize expenses to keep your finances organized.

### Calendar Integration

The calendar is integrated with both the task manager and financial manager, helping you keep track of important dates, deadlines, and expenses in one place.

### Entertainment Manager

Create and manage several lists, such as movies or TV shows to watch, games to play, and places to visit. These lists are integrated with APIs such as IMDb, providing detailed information on each entry.
